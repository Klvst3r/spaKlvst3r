Error de permisos en Linux



My application is being deployed to AWS Lightsail(LAMP) and when I try to run artisan migrate it says:

Copy Code
```The stream or file "/opt/bitnami/projects/app-name/storage/logs/laravel.log" could not be opened in append mode: failed to o
pen stream: Permission denied```

Soluci√≥n

no worries, yea i'm pretty novice to linux/unix system so some commands(even the basic ones like nano/sudo) are foreign to me.

Anyway I managed to fix it as I was only granting permission to via this command:

Copy Code
sudo chmod -R 775 storage
The fix was to add this:

Copy Code
sudo chmod -R ugo+rw storage
